convolutional network from scratch to recognize scenes


Problem 1: defining a simple network architecture and add jittering, normalization, and regularization to increase recognition accuracy to 50, 60, or perhaps 70%

Problem 2: fine-tuning a pre-trained deep network to achieve about 85% accuracy on the task. We will use the pretrained AlexNet network which was not
trained to recognize scenes at all.

These two approaches represent the most common approaches to recognition problems in computer vision today -- train a deep network from scratch if you have enough data 
(it's not always obvious whether or not you do), and if you cannot then instead fine-tune a pre-trained network.
